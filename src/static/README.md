# STATIC

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

But keep in mind, that there is no webpack processing involved. In most cases it is better to use the /assets directory.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#static).
